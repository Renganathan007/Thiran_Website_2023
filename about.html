            <p>Two associations of PSG Tech, the Computer Applications Association and the Computational Sciences Association come together to bring you the 14'th edition of THIRAN, an intra-collegiate technical event. Thiran isn't simply a bid to find the technical nonpareil of PSG Tech, it also endeavors to be a platform where participants will be tested on their ability to think on their feet and outside the proverbial box. Every year, a heady combination of departmental pride and the pressure to prove oneself leads to an exhilarating clash between the best of PSG Tech. This year, the stakes are higher, the questions more challenging and the competition more intense. So, are you ready?</p>
